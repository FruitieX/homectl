#
# The next step is to configure any groups, scenes and routines according to
# your needs.
#
# Continuing with our example, we will:
#
# - Group lights by room or whether they are upstairs / downstairs. For
#   convenience, we will also create a group containing all lights.
# - Create commonly used scenes such as "default", "night light",
#   "all off", "party mode".
#
# We wont configure any routines since these won't work out of the box without
# a few sensors (light switches, motion detectors, etc.) configured.
#
# Note that even without routines, you can still activate scenes and change
# device states via the homectl UI.
