# homectl frontend

## Setup

Refer to the README in the root of the repo.

## Features

- List devices, optionally by group
- Color, brightness and power controls for lights
- List and activate "scenes" which are presets for device states
- Save and edit scenes

Planned features:

- Dashboard view with tiles displaying useful information (think time and date, weather, public transit schedules, state of some devices, hotkeys for favorite scenes, etc)
- Authentication so I can run this thing on the public Internet without fear of people interfering with my lights :P
- Maybe some interface for customizing the backend's config file. Before the UI this (editing a config file) was the only way to interact with the backend (apart from hitting physical buttons on light switches)
